 title: "Who am I?"
 content: "My area of focus lies in fullstack web development, but my goal above all is to create experiences that profit the most.<br>
 Accessibility and ease of use are the metrics to always have in mind. Designers and developers shouldn't forget that behind an interface, there's a human using it.<br><br>
 In my free time I like to spend quality time with my family and friends and my main interests are music, art and culture."
